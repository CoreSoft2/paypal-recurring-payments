PayPal recurring payments (with flexible amount) integration.

1. Create object instance:
$recurring = new PaypalRecurringPayments($gateway);

2. Obtain billing agreement from PayPal, user will be redirected there
$recurring->obtainBillingAgreement("Test subscription", "testuser@gmail.com", 'USD', $resultData);

3. Read PayPal's response
$recurring->getBillingDetails();
It will return billing details (most important are token and payerId)

4. Make an initial payment (could be $1.00), it will return billing agreement ID
$billingAgreementId = $recurring->doInitialPayment($details->token, $details->payerId, $amount);

5. Now you can perform transparent transactions using the Billing Agreement ID
$recurring->doSubscriptionPayment($billingAgreementId, $amount, $resultData);
